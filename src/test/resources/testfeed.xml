            <description><![CDATA[<h2>Editor - Catrin Hedström</h2> <p><em>Candyman</em> is a supernatural slasher film directed by Nia DaCosta and written by Jordan Peele, Win Rosenfeld and also DaCosta. The film is a direct sequel to the 1992 film of the same name and the fourth film in the <em>Candyman</em> film series.</p> <p>In 2019, twenty-seven years after the events of the first film, visual artist Anthony McCoy (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) lives in Chicago with his girlfriend, art gallery director Brianna Cartwright (Teyonah Parris). Brianna's brother Troy shares with them the urban legend of Helen Lyle (Virginia Madsen), a graduate student who went on a killing spree in the early 1990's. Lyle's rampage culminated in a bonfire outside Chicago's Cabrini-Green housing project, where she attempted to sacrifice a baby in the fire. The residents were able to rescue the child before Helen perished in the fire in an apparent act of self-immolation.</p> <p>Desperate for a creative spark to turn his career around, Anthony roams around the Cabrini-Green housing project for inspiration. There, he eventually meets William Burke, a laundromat owner who introduces him to the story of the Candyman (Tony Todd). When Burke was a child he had a frightening encounter with a hook-handed man named Sherman Fields.  Police believed Fields put a razor blade in a piece of candy that was given to a white girl. Young William inadvertently alerted the police to Sherman's presence inside the walls of one of the Cabrini-Green towers, leading them to beat Fields to death. When children continued to receive candy with razor blades inside, Sherman Fields was exonerated.  Since then, the legend implies that if somebody says "Candyman" five times to a mirror, he will appear and kill the summoner.</p> <h5>CATRIN HEDSTRÖM</h5> <p><em>Candyman</em> editor, Catrin Hedström joins us while on location for her current collaborative effort with director Nia DaCosta, Marvel Studios' <em>The Marvels.</em>  The Swedish native first met DaCosta when she was studying at NYU.

            <description><![CDATA[<h2>Editors - Jess Brunetto, Susan Vaill ACE, Ali Greer</h2> <p><em>Hacks</em> editors Jess Brunetto, Susan Vaill ACE and Ali Greer each find themselves nominated for an Emmy® award for their work on Season One of their hit series.  For those not familiar with the show, <i>Hacks</i> is an American comedy-drama series created by Lucia Aniello, Paul W. Downs, and Jen Statsky that streams on HBO Max.  The show tells the story of two very funny women at different points in their careers.  Deborah Vance, a legendary Las Vegas stand-up comedy diva, is struggling to maintain relevance while the head of the casino where she performs tries to pare down on her performance dates. Ava is a Gen Z comedy writer who is unable to find work due to being "canceled" over an insensitive tweet. The two reluctantly team up to freshen up Vance's material, while learning to respect each other's differences along the way.</p> <h5>JESS BRUNETTO</h5> <p>Jess Brunetto is a director, writer, producer and editor. Her film work has screened at Cannes, Venice and Sundance. Her directorial debut <em>Sisters</em> (2021) premiered at SXSW and was nominated for the Grand Jury Award.  In addition to <em>Hacks,</em> her other editor credits include; <em>Awkwafina Is Nora from Queens</em> (2020), <em>Broad City</em> (2014), <em>American Vandal</em> (2017) and Jordan Peele's <em>The Last O.G.</em> (2018), on which she also served as an associate producer.</p> <h5>SUSAN VAILL ACE</h5> <p>Susan's love of music-driven storytelling has led her to be described as 'a legendary music supervisor masquerading as an award-winning editor.'  After assistant-editing documentaries and feature films like <em>The Last Samurai</em> (2003), Susan edited over 70 episodes of <em>Grey's Anatomy</em> (2005) which won the Golden Globe for Best Drama Series in 2008. Susan also directed three episodes of the series, one of which featured an Emmy-winning performance by guest actress Loretta Devine.  In addition to <em>Hacks,</em> her other television editor credits include; <em>Space Force</em> (2020), <em>Grandfathered</em> (2015), <em>Me, Myself and I </em>(2017), <em>This Is Us</em> (2016), and <em>Lodge 49</em> (2018).</p> <h5>ALI GREER</h5> <p>In addition to her Emmy® nomination for <em>Hacks</em>, Ali was twice nominated for an ACE Eddie award for her work on the series, <em>Portlandia.</em>  In fact, Ali's editorial career is highlighted by several standout series in the comedy genre.  Her time as an assistant editor was punctuated with a stint on <em>Kroll Show</em> (2015) as well as the aforementioned <em>Portlandia</em> (2015).  From there she went on to edit such shows as <em>Dream Corp LLC</em> (2018), <em>Black Monday</em> (2020) and <em>Schmigadoon!</em> (2021).</p> <h2>Editing Hacks</h2> <p>In our discussion with the <i>Hacks</i> editing team of Jess Brunetto, Susan Vaill ACE and Ali Greer, we talk about:</p> <ul> <li><span style="font-size: 1rem">The money is no object approach to needle drops</span></li> <li><span style="font-size: 1rem">The danger of checking your email on a Friday night</span></li> <li>Breaking the rules of network television</li> <li>Honoring When Harry Met Sally</li> <li>Doing mixes over Zoom...in a car</li> </ul> <h2>The Credits</h2> <p>Get your free 100GB of media transfer at <a href= "https://www.massive.io/the-rough-cut">MASV</a></p> <p>Visit <a href="http://www.extrememusic.com">ExtremeMusic</a> for all your production audio needs</p> <p>Check out the free trial of <a href= "https://my.avid.com/get/media-composer-ultimate-trial">Media Composer | Ultimate</a></p> <p><a href="https://theroughcutpod.com/subscribe/">Subscribe</a> to The Rough Cut podcast and never miss an episode</p> <p>Visit The Rough Cut on <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTAfd5RmCI0hAP3Oh4WGdnw?view_as=subscriber"> YouTube</a></p>]]></description>

Assistant editor Kar Naranjo, VFX editor Brad Tobler and sound editor Craig Henighan are all on hand for the film.

            <description><![CDATA[<h2>Editor - Dody Dorn ACE, Assistant Editor - Carlos <span class= "itemprop">Castillón</span></h2> <p><em>Army of the Dead</em> editor Dody Dorn ACE and asst editor Carlos Castillón were quite busy during the past year or so.  Not only did they edit the new film from Zack Snyder, but they also did his cut of <em>Justice League</em> during their "break".</p> <p>With <em>Army of the Dead</em>, Snyder is back doing what he does best, blending different genres into something not seen before.  It's a "zombie" movie; in some ways a follow up to Snyder’s <em>Dawn of the Dead</em>.  Then you’ve got the heist movie genre, in that the protagonists are racing against a clock to steal a big pile of cash. Finally you’ve got Las Vegas, which isn’t a genre of movie…but it’s Vegas; always a category unto itself.   No matter how you categorize it, <em>Army of the Dead</em> delivers the requisite action, comedy, gore and moments of tenderness one would hope for in a zombie-Vegas apocalypse.<sup id="cite_ref-EWNov2020CoverStory_2-0" class= "reference"></sup></p> <h5>DODY DORN ACE</h5> <p>Although she began her career as a sound editor, Dody Dorn made her transition to picture editing with projects such as the director's cut for <em>Terminator 2</em>.

Not only did they edit the new film from Zack Snyder, but they also did his cut of <em>Justice League</em> during their "break".</p> <p>With <em>Army of the Dead</em>, Snyder is back doing what he does best, blending different genres into something not seen before.  It's a "zombie" movie; in some ways a follow up to Snyder’s <em>Dawn of the Dead</em>.  Then you’ve got the heist movie genre, in that the protagonists are racing against a clock to steal a big pile of cash. Finally you’ve got Las Vegas, which isn’t a genre of movie…but it’s Vegas; always a category unto itself.   No matter how you categorize it, <em>Army of the Dead</em> delivers the requisite action, comedy, gore and moments of tenderness one would hope for in a zombie-Vegas apocalypse.</p> DODY DORN ACE <p>Although she began her career as a sound editor, Dody Dorn made her transition to picture editing with projects such as the director's cut for <em>Terminator 2</em>.

            <description><![CDATA[<h2>Editor, Doc Crotzer ACE</h2> <p><i>Chaos Walking</i> editor, Doc Crotzer ACE would be the first to tell you that most of the time when you’re working on a movie or tv show, you’re trying to remove noise; audible noise, visual noise, story noise.  But in his new film with director Doug Liman, Doc and his team worked very hard to add it in.  Why would they do that?  Because the noise in <em>Chaos Walking</em> is the outwardly expressed thoughts of the characters.  It’s literally their thoughts in words and images that float around their heads, for everyone else to see and hear.</p> <p>Think about what that would be like to convey in editing.  You have the spoken words in production audio and ADR. Then you have the characters true thoughts in a voice over that’s happening a few beats after the spoken words.  Then you have this purple cloud of visual imagery that ebbs and flows depending on how strongly they feel about something, all the way up into actual images representing their thoughts. That’s a lot of work and a lot of timing and a lot of creative thinking, and Doc tells us all about how he and his crew "brought the noise" to <em>Chaos Walking</em>.</p> <h2>Editing Chaos Walking</h2> <p>In our discussion with <i>Chaos Walking</i> editor, Doc Crotzer ACE we talk about:</p> <ul> <li>Using ScriptSync to quiet "the noise"</li> <li>Why such a large post team was assembled for this film</li> <li>The challenge of editing a film over several years</li> <li>What makes a good assistant</li> </ul> <h2>The Credits</h2> <p>Visit <a href="http://www.extrememusic.com">ExtremeMusic</a> for all your production audio needs</p> <p>Listen to the <a href= "https://theroughcutpod.com/little-fires-everywhere/">Little Fires Everywhere</a> podcast with Doc's former assistant editor, Amelia Allwarden</p> <p>See the latest <a href= "https://www.avid.com/special-offers#Video">Special Offers</a> for Avid Media Composer and Media Composer Ultimate</p> <p>Learn Avid for free with <a href= "https://my.avid.com/get/media-composer-first">Media Composer | First</a></p> <p><a href="https://theroughcutpod.com/subscribe/">Subscribe</a> to The Rough Cut podcast and never miss an episode</p> <p>Visit The Rough Cut on <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTAfd5RmCI0hAP3Oh4WGdnw?view_as=subscriber"> YouTube</a></p>]]></description>

That’s a lot of work and a lot of timing and a lot of creative thinking, and Doc tells us all about how he and his crew "brought the noise" to <em>Chaos Walking</em>.</p> Editing Chaos Walking <p>In our discussion with <i>Chaos Walking</i> editor, Doc Crotzer ACE we talk about:</p> <ul> <li>Using ScriptSync to quiet "the noise"</li> <li>Why such a large post team was assembled for this film</li> <li>The challenge of editing a film over several years</li> <li>What makes a good assistant</li> </ul> The Credits <p>Visit <a href="http://www.extrememusic.com">ExtremeMusic</a> for all your production audio needs</p> <p>Listen to the <a href= "https://theroughcutpod.com/little-fires-everywhere/">Little Fires Everywhere</a> podcast with Doc's former assistant editor, Amelia Allwarden</p> <p>See the latest <a href= "https://www.avid.com/special-offers#Video">Special Offers</a> for Avid Media Composer and Media Composer Ultimate</p> <p>Learn Avid for free with <a href= "https://my.avid.com/get/media-composer-first">Media Composer | First</a></p> <p><a href="https://theroughcutpod.com/subscribe/">Subscribe</a> to The Rough Cut podcast and never miss an episode</p> <p>Visit The Rough Cut on <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTAfd5RmCI0hAP3Oh4WGdnw?view_as=subscriber"> YouTube</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

            <itunes:summary>Editor, Doc Crotzer ACE Chaos Walking editor, Doc Crotzer ACE would be the first to tell you that most of the time when you’re working on a movie or tv show, you’re trying to remove noise; audible noise, visual noise, story noise.  But in his new film with director Doug Liman, Doc and his team worked very hard to add it in.  Why would they do that?  Because the noise in Chaos Walking is the outwardly expressed thoughts of the characters.  It’s literally their thoughts in words and images that floa</itunes:summary>

            <description><![CDATA[<h2>Filmmaker, Chloe Zhao</h2> <p><em>Nomadland</em> filmmaker Chloe Zhao is as "indie" as it gets, but she may not be able to hold onto that title much longer considering that she just finished directing the new Marvel film <em>Eternals</em>, due out in November 2021.  But for now let’s keep our attention on her indie cred and how she started turning heads in the film world.  We’ll start with her debut feature, <em>Songs My Brothers Taught Me</em>.  She wrote, directed and co-edited this one, as well as having co-produced it with Forest Whitaker.  The film was accepted and lauded at both the Sundance and Cannes film festivals.</p> <p>Her next film, <em>The Rider</em>, was also a highly acclaimed picture about a Lakota cowboy named Brady.  The film was made with non-professional actors on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation.  Although this film also made it to Cannes, what is most significant is the use of non-professional actors.  The reason being that, with a couple of exceptions in the lead roles, Chloe does the same thing with <em>Nomadland</em>.  And it really has an impact on the feel of the movie in a good and very necessary way.  If you look at the credits on IMDB, you’ll see character names such as; Swanky, Patty, Doug, Angela, Carl…and then when you look over to see the names of the “actors” who played them…you see the exact same names.  As I mentioned, there are two big exceptions to the "non actor" aspect.  Frances McDormand plays "Fern" and David Strathairn plays, you guessed it..."Dave".</p> <p>The film is based on the 2017 non-fiction book <strong>Nomadland: Surviving America in the Twenty-First Century</strong> by Jessica Bruder, and is about a woman who leaves her small town to travel around the American West.  Of course it’s about a lot more than that, but you should definitely give the film a look to fill in the rest of the blanks for yourself.</p> <h2>Editing Nomadland</h2> <p>In our discussion with <em>Nomadland</em> filmmaker Chloe Zhao we talk about:</p> <ul> <li>The influence of Manga and comic books on her style and love of editing</li> <li>Whether or not editors should be on location and on set</li> <li>How she takes inspiration from director Wong Kar-wai</li> <li>Abandoning the two-shot</li> <li>How her nomad-like editorial setup has evolved</li> </ul> <h2>The Credits</h2> <p>Visit <a href="http://www.extrememusic.com">ExtremeMusic</a> for all your production audio needs</p> <p>Get to know the <a href= "https://americancinemaeditors.org/">American Cinema Editors</a></p> <p>See the latest <a href= "https://www.avid.com/special-offers#Video">Special Offers</a> for Avid Media Composer and Media Composer Ultimate</p> <p>Learn Avid for free with <a href= "https://my.avid.com/get/media-composer-first">Media Composer | First</a></p> <p><a href="https://theroughcutpod.com/subscribe/">Subscribe</a> to The Rough Cut podcast and never miss an episode</p> <p>Visit The Rough Cut on <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTAfd5RmCI0hAP3Oh4WGdnw?view_as=subscriber"> YouTube</a></p>]]></description>

Although Cohen had stated he was retiring his Borat character back in 2007, largely due to the fact that everybody now knows who Borat is and that it would be difficult to pull off the same feat he accomplished in the original film, current geopolitical events dictated that the world needed Borat once again.</p> <p>The main question is, how do you make this film happen in secret AND during a global pandemic?

Craig Alpert ACE not only logged some hours on the original "Borat" movie, but also has films such as <em>Knocked Up</em>, <em>Pineapple Express</em> and <em>Deadpool 2</em> under his belt.  Editor James Thomas goes all the way back with Sacha to the classic British comedy series, <em>The 11 O'Clock Show</em>, where characters like Borat and Ali G were born, and James would continue to be a mainstay on Sacha's work from them on.  Rounding out the team, Michael Giambra brought his formidable editorial skills in comedy and docu-style storytelling from his experiences on <em>Nathan For You</em>, <em>The Eric Andre Show</em>, <em>Kroll Show</em> and <em>Baskets</em>.</p> <h2>Editing Borat - Subsequent Moviefilm</h2> <p>In our discussion with <em>Borat - Subsequent Moviefilm</em> editors; Craig Alpert ACE, James Thomas and Mike Giambra, we talk about:</p> <ul> <li>When then idea for bring Borat back came about and working in secrecy</li> <li>Closing the cutting rooms and their methods for going remote in the pandemic</li> <li>How the story of the film evolved alongside politics and the pandemic</li> <li>Balancing the workload amongst multiple editors</li> <li>How crucial transcriptions are for finding footage</li> <li>Cutting docu-style "man on the street" scenes vs scripted</li> <li>The benefit of doing old school "KEM" string outs</li> <li>Having fun temping Borat's voice</li> </ul> <h2>The Credits</h2> <p>Visit <a href="http://www.extrememusic.com">ExtremeMusic</a> for all your production audio needs</p> <p>See the latest <a href= "https://www.avid.com/special-offers#Video">Special Offers</a> for Avid Media Composer and Media Composer Ultimate</p> <p>Learn Avid for free with <a href= "https://my.avid.com/get/media-composer-first">Media Composer | First</a></p> <p><a href="https://theroughcutpod.com/subscribe/">Subscribe</a> to The Rough Cut podcast and never miss an episode</p> <p>Visit The Rough Cut on <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTAfd5RmCI0hAP3Oh4WGdnw?view_as=subscriber"> YouTube</a></p>]]></description>

The creative partnership between Clooney and Mirrione currently spans over eighteen years and encompasses seven feature films, culminating with their latest effort, <em>The Midnight Sky</em>.  Not one to rest on his laurels too long, over that same time period Mirrione would also edit five of <span class="itemprop">Alejandro G.

This is the second time working together for Alan and Aaron, and since this is also only the second thing that Aaron Sorkin has ever directed, the basic math will tell you that Alan is his "go to" guy.  And why not?  Aside from doing Aaron’s first film, <em>Molly’s Game</em>, Alan has proved his mettle on just about every kind of film.  Dramas like <em>American Hustle</em> and <em>Trumbo</em>.  Comedies like <em>Dodgeball</em> and <em>Meet the Fockers.

But "Chicago Seven" takes on the even more ambitious challenge of detailing an actual historical event, which is the trial of seven men charged with inciting the riots that took place in 1968 at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago.  As you would imagine, this is a big story with a big cast and has many details that need to be fleshed out and brought to life in the most engaging way possible.</p> <p>In our discussion with Alan, he talks about:</p> <ul> <li>The challenge of setting up the characters and context of the film in the opening prologue sequence</li> <li>Negotiating for who and what you need in the cutting room</li> <li>The effect of the pandemic on finishing the film from the director's cut onward</li> <li>What he looks for in an assistant</li> </ul> <p>Visit <a href="http://www.extrememusic.com">ExtremeMusic</a> for all your production audio needs</p> <p>See the latest <a href= "https://www.avid.com/special-offers#Video">Special Offers</a> for Avid Media Composer</p> <p>Try  <a href= "https://my.avid.com/get/media-composer-ultimate-trial">Media Composer | Ultimate</a> for free</p> <p><a href="https://theroughcutpod.com/subscribe/">Subscribe</a> to The Rough Cut podcast and never miss an episode</p> <p>Visit The Rough Cut on <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTAfd5RmCI0hAP3Oh4WGdnw?view_as=subscriber"> YouTube</a></p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Ted Lasso editors, Melissa McCoy and AJ Catoline join this episode of The Rough Cut podcast to tell us about what goes on in the cutting room to make the magic from the locker room.</p> <p>Ted Lasso is an AppleTV+ series developed by Jason Sudeikis, Bill Lawrence, Joe Kelly and Brendan Hunt, based on a character of the same name that Sudeikis first portrayed in a series of promos for NBC Sports' coverage of the The English Premier League.

Justin’s career got off to a slow start as an assistant sound editor on a little film called <a href= "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167260/?ref_=nm_flmg_snd_29">The Lord of The Rings: The Return of The King</a>.  Apparently Peter Jackson liked what he heard because Justin would return as sound effects editor for all three films for The Hobbit . Along the way he wore many hats as dialogue editor, sound designer, re-recording mixer, foley artist; including being the dialogue editor on a truly unique film and awesome movie called <a href= "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1136608/?ref_=nm_knf_t1">District 9</a>.  In response to the shortcomings he was finding in the tools and processes in audio post, Justin began developing software tools to address these needs with his company, The Cargo Cult.  Recently he introduced a new product called Matchbox that simplifies the common yet complicated problem of change management between not only picture editing and audio post, but also picture editing and VFX.</p> <p>Our next stop is with LA-based sound editors Kami Asgar and Jess Parks, who are working with Sony R&D on what could be some game changing technology that they’re using for the upcoming films, <a href= "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4513678/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_7">Ghostbusters: Afterlife</a> and <a href= "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7097896/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0">Venom: Let There Be Carnage</a>.  The technology is called the 360 Virtual Mixing Environment and it enables you to reproduce the sound field of a real-life studio or sound stage through headphones.  Kami has been working as a sound editor in film and television for many years on just about every type of project you can imagine, but Jess Parks has a bit of a different story.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Super editors <a href= "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1928737/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_10">Nona Khodai</a>, <a href= "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0619739/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0">Cedric Nairn-Smith</a> and <a href= "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0435624/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0">David Kaldor</a> join the Rough Cut to talk about their work on <em>The Boys</em>, an Amazon Prime Video original series.  <em>The Boys</em> shows us a world where super heroes are actually real, but they’re not exactly heroic, and in some cases really bad people.  This incredibly popular series (a spinoff series was just announced) is an adaptation of a comic book, or more accurately, graphic novel...because it is a pretty graphic show.  Amazon politely advises you before each episode that what you’re about to see is content most appropriate for an 18+ audience.  And if you’ve seen the show, you probably won’t try to debate that.  But <em>The Boys</em> is incredibly original, and funny, and action packed, and dramatic and surprising in all kinds of good ways.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Super editors <a href= "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1928737/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_10">Nona Khodai</a>, <a href= "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0619739/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0">Cedric Nairn-Smith</a> and <a href= "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0435624/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0">David Kaldor</a> join the Rough Cut to talk about their work on <em>The Boys</em>, an Amazon Prime Video original series.  <em>The Boys</em> shows us a world where super heroes are actually real, but they’re not exactly heroic, and in some cases really bad people.  This incredibly popular series (a spinoff series was just announced) is an adaptation of a comic book, or more accurately, graphic novel...because it is a pretty graphic show.  Amazon politely advises you before each episode that what you’re about to see is content most appropriate for an 18+ audience.  And if you’ve seen the show, you probably won’t try to debate that.  But <em>The Boys</em> is incredibly original, and funny, and action packed, and dramatic and surprising in all kinds of good ways.  And all of this is thanks, in no small part, to the contributions of Nona, Cedric and David.

Being nominated for (and winning!) an Emmy is nothing new for Nena, having won in 2016 for <a href= "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5087544/?ref_=ttep_ep7">Project Greenlight</a>, but this is not only Lynarion’s first Emmy nomination, it’s for one of her first big shows as an editor.  Her experience as an assistant editor has helped Lynarion become a very organized editor.  Nena….well, not so much.  But what she lacks in organization, she makes up for as a mentor and champion for her assistants.  And, organized or not, both editors are very talented storytellers.  In this edition of The Rough Cut, they talk to us about; marking and organizing multiple takes of jokes, using emotional moments and looks to punctuate a montage, the directorial style of Kerry Washington and much more.</p> <p>Visit <a href="http://www.extrememusic.com">ExtremeMusic</a> for all your production audio needs!</p> <p>Learn Avid for free with <a href= "https://my.avid.com/get/media-composer-first">Media Composer | First</a>!</p> <p>Subscribe to <a href= "https://shop.avid.com/ccrz__ProductDetails?viewState=DetailView&cartID=&sku=DYNA12345"> Media Composer | Ultimate</a> and get the best Avid has to offer!</p> <p><a href="https://theroughcutpod.com/subscribe/">Subscribe</a> to The Rough Cut podcast and never miss an episode!</p> <p>Visit The Rough Cut on <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTAfd5RmCI0hAP3Oh4WGdnw?view_as=subscriber"> YouTube</a>!</p> <p>Listen to <a href= "http://www.theroughcutpod.com/troop-zero">Catherine Haight ACE</a> talk about her film, Troop Zero.</p> <p>Send me your feedback at matt@theroughcutpod.com or leave a message at (781) 334-8369 or on the <a href= "http://theroughcutpod.com/contact/">CONTACT</a> page.</p>]]></description>

At each point they took a copious amount of notes that would be crucial in helping them to find the movie and its emotional touch points from within a mountain of material.  The end result is a two-hour journey that not only tells the story of the band, but details an enduring friendship and personal evolution lead by their band mate, childhood friend and spiritual leader, the late Adam "MCA" Yauch.</p> <p>Learn Avid for free with <a href= "https://my.avid.com/get/media-composer-first">Media Composer | First</a>!</p> <p>Subscribe to <a href= "https://shop.avid.com/ccrz__ProductDetails?viewState=DetailView&cartID=&sku=DYNA12345"> Media Composer | Ultimate</a> and get the best Avid has to offer!</p> <p><a href="http://theroughcutpod.com/subscribe/">Subscribe</a> to The Rough Cut podcast and never miss an episode!</p> <p>Send me your feedback at matt@theroughcutpod.com or, even better, call and leave me a message at (781) 334-8369.</p>]]></content:encoded>

To help deliver this wickedly stylish story, Rian turned once again to editor, Bob Ducsay.  Having worked together on <a href= "https://www.starwars.com/the-last-jedi">The Last Jedi</a> and <a href="https://www.sonypictures.com/movies/looper">Looper</a>, Bob and Rian's familiarity and shared sensibilities not only combined to make a great film, but also an enjoyable one to make.</p> <p>"Making a movie is really hard and you work a lot of hours. And one of the things about getting to know somebody really well and providing what they need is that it makes everything all that much more fun.  And we have a blast working together".</p> <p>Keeping the audience engaged and informed, while at the same time creating the misdirection that's necessary in a mystery, was what made Bob's work on <em>Knives Out</em> truly admirable; most notably in the film's opening interrogation scenes.</p> <p>"I would say that's probably the most difficult sequence in the movie, because it's so essential. And at the same time, you plop the audience in the same room for a really long time. And so pace becomes a very important part of putting that sequence together".</p> <p>In this edition of The Rough Cut, Bob shares lots of anecdotes that working editors will enjoy and relate to, as well as great advice for film school students or anybody else that's trying to pursue a career in film-making.</p> <p>"If you read a screenplay and the screenplay's great, you're probably going to have a pretty darn good movie.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Better Call Saul editor, <a href= "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0564604/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0">Chris McCaleb ACE</a> has quite a track record with "fan favorite" hour-long dramas; starting with his role as an assistant editor on AMC's groundbreaking series, <a href= "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0903747/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0">Breaking Bad</a>.  Since his time on Breaking Bad, Chris has gone on to lead editorial duties on such shows as <a href= "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2543312/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0">Halt and Catch Fire</a>, <a href= "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2707408/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_3">Narcos</a>, <a href= "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3743822/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0">Fear The Walking Dead</a>, <a href= "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6128254/?ref_=nm_flmg_edt_3">Lodge 49</a> and, now in its fifth season, <a href= "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3032476/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0">Better Call Saul</a>.</p> <p>Chris talks to us about how even the best laid plans in storytelling can all be for naught.  "I think every editor has had that experience where you have a great script and you have great footage and, for whatever reason, it just didn't work out the way that everybody had planned or everybody had hoped. Maybe in production they ran out of time or they had to cut half a day because of some scheduling reasons.  And so I think you're always reinventing in the editing room. You're always trying to find a better way".</p> <p>Like every editor, Chris has learned some valuable lessons along the way and shares one of his favorites here on the podcast.  "The advice I always give people, which was advice given to me by <a href= "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0228893/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0">Kelley Dixon</a>, is that you've got to watch all your dailies.  Part of my process is to just watch everything.  Sometimes the best stuff won't show up on a script in the Avid.  It'll show up on your monitor as a look that somebody gives or the look that somebody didn't mean to give because they're so in the moment...happy accidents...those are the things I look for".</p> <p>And that's just scratching the surface of everything Chris has to say, so make sure to enjoy every minute of this edition of The Rough Cut!</p> <p>Here's the <a href= "https://cdn-www.avid.com/-/media/avid/files/corona-virus-2020/media-composer-remote-options-guide.pdf?la=en&v=20200313200023"> Media Composer Remote Options Guide.</a></p> <p><a href="http://theroughcutpod.com/subscribe/">Subscribe to The Rough Cut</a> for more great interviews with the heroes of the editing room!</p> <p>Email me your suggestions, stories and questions at <a href= "mailto:matt@theroughcutpod.com">matt@theroughcutpod.com</a> or, even better, call and leave me a message at (781) 334-8369.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p>]]></description>

One of my mentors, <a href="http://theroughcutpod.com/dan-lebental-ace/">Dan Lebental,</a> was working on Spider-Man and he put my name forward. And it was tough. I mean, there were a lot of "no's".  A LOT of "no's".  And the way I just sort of had it in my head is, "no" is just an annoying part of the conversation.  And while everyone was saying "no" to me, I was saying, "This is so great! We're talking about me working on Spider-Man!  And yeah, you're saying 'no', but that's just one part of the conversation. The bigger picture here is we're talking about me working on Spider-Man!"</p> <p>She also shares some key advice on how to get your name out there for the jobs you really want..."I have a rule that I don't ever ask for jobs.  I find, especially when you work with people who are higher up in the industry, that people are constantly asking them for things.  And I didn't want to put myself in that category.  So one tool I always use is, I always state what I want and let the people who can help me know what I want.

Recorded while the action is literally happening on location, Paul details the unique workflow he employed for Edgar Wright's music video brought to life.  Shot on 35mm film, Baby Driver not only required Paul to edit on set with an elaborate video tap and Qtake-based capture process, it was also almost completely "pre-edited" using music, sound fx, and "table read" audio before production ever began.  This process allowed Paul to make sure the highly-choreographed action being shot would work perfectly once it was dropped into the Avid timeline in place of the temp material.  Paul also discusses the unique editing aesthetic that has become synonymous with Edgar Wright movies.</p> <p><a href="http://theroughcutpod.com/subscribe/">Subscribe to The Rough Cut</a> for more great interviews with the heroes of the editing room!</p> <p>Are you going to SxSW?

If I use it in a podcast, I'll send you something cool!</p> <p> </p> <p>TRANSCRIPT>></p> <p>Matt Feury<br /> Okay, ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage editor Bob Ducsay.</p> <p>Bob Ducsay<br /> Matt! Nice to be here with you.</p> <p>Matt Feury<br /> Okay, so that was a little intense. Reflections? Thoughts? What do you remember most about cutting that sequence there?</p> <p>Bob Ducsay<br /> It looks exhausting to do.</p> <p>Matt Feury<br /> It felt exhausting.</p> <p>Bob Ducsay<br /> I know. But interestingly enough, this particular sequence had challenges that you wouldn't necessarily guess because a lot of the great complexities of the sequence were worked out in prep and in early post production. In this particular case, in early post production. This sequence was pre-visualized, which is sort of a low resolution cartoon that's made of the sequence. But what happens in a sequence like that is you have this template that you start with, but then you start to make all of the changes in the sequence as the photography comes in, and this sequence was no different in that way. And one of the big challenges of a sequence like this is because it's so visual effects intensive. In my editorial job, I'm heavily involved with the visual effects, and mapping all that out, and how all of those things interact, and all of the timings, even though some of those things will have been worked out, you know, as a template and a starting point in the pre-vis, there's an enormous amount more work that has to happen. So this sequence is really a lot about the complexity of the visual effects. But you get all of these extra things when you're shooting. And so the sequence changes and evolves over time. And another thing about the sequence is, this isn't the whole Battle of Crait. This isn't just a clip from it. But even what's in the final movie was considerably shorter than what was originally envisioned and photograph but, you know, in the total run of the movie, we found that it was a little bit long, so we compressed it. So those are the sort of challenges that a sequence like this has.</p> <p>Matt Feury<br /> You mentioned the animatic part of it. I found that really interesting, the pre-prep, because I remember a lot of the talk about the original Star Wars back in 1977, George Lucas would cut together shots of aerial dogfights from old World War Two movies, as a point of reference, and this is very similar to that, where you're literally putting together a sequence that represents what you're finally going to do, and then laying over the new shots on top of that.</p> <p>Bob Ducsay<br /> Well, to some degree, yes. And I mean, that's amazing what they did back in, you know, 1976, when they were making the movie. Because they didn't have the ability, they didn't have these tools that we have now. So, it's a fantastic way of envisioning and it's something that we kind of refer to as rip-o-matics. And we still do those sort of things because even in this film, there are times when you want something that just represents something that you think you need, and if we can go to another movie that we know has something like that, it could be another Star Wars movie, but it could be something completely different depending on the idea. And we'll source that and put it that in as a temporary thing that might only represent what the camera is supposed to do. It might represent the rough length of the thing. But it's something to allow us to envision what we're looking for and what we need from the visual effects guys, and then ultimately what happens in post production on these movies is that you have a post-viz department. And what that is, is there's a series of animators that are around that you can literally walk down the hall and you could say, I need a shot where the Falcon dodges this TIE Fighter moving left to right, and does this sort of thing. And they will build that shot. And then that shot becomes a template for for ILM to do the visual effect. So it's a very iterative process, but it's an unbelievable tool that allows us to represent things that don't exist.</p> <p>Matt Feury<br /> So I find that, as I do these interviews, I forget until the very end to ask about the overall process and people go, "Why didn't you ask them what they shot and what the editing room setup was like"? So, could you just walk us through a brief synopsis of the editorial process from the handoff from production into post and over to the other viz and sound departments?</p> <p>Bob Ducsay<br /> Sure. Well, the the movie was photographed principally in the United Kingdom, outside of London, at Pinewood Studios. And at Pinewood, FotoKem, which was one of our vendors, the lab vendor, they built a digital lab there, including scanning. So all the scanning was in house and just for our operation. The movie was photographed I'd say somewhere around 70%, maybe 75% on 35 millimeter scope film. And then the rest of it was a combination of Alexa digital Alexa 65 digital and some small amount of IMAX. So the film would come in, they'd scan everything at 4K, they would build DNX 115 files for us to use in editorial but then they would generate all the other various needs for people, including pulling material for ILM, because we're turning visual effects over while we're shooting. And so there was a whole infrastructure put together for this particular film that was specific to this film.</p> <p>Matt Feury<br /> Early on in your career you did films like The Mummy, The Mummy Returns. And those were groundbreaking in terms of the visual effects stuff done there. There were treatments that you used in those films that became points of reference for years after that, with the particle effects that you did. Here in Star Wars, you already have this sort of, it feels like a template about the visual world there. Did you find that constraining that you had to sort of conform to this way of doing things, or did you take the existing elements and tweak them and take them in different directions?</p> <p>Bob Ducsay<br /> Well, when you talk about some things in the movie,. I mean, it is true, you know, a Tie Fighter looks like a Tie Fighter, an X wing looks like an X wing. And so there are some things that a really strong template exists for, but then there's many, many things that are specific to this film that are designed from the ground up. I mean, if you think of the sequence with Snoke, who Andy Serkis plays in motion capture, and he's a digital character. So that's all very, very specific to this film, and there's there's a lot of things that are like that. And then even in like this sequence, you know, the the skim speeders, which are the vehicles that you saw in this clip, one of the things that Ryan Johnson the director wanted was he had a very, very specific, I'm going to call it "art direction" notion of what that material should look like, and what the colors should be. And this went into prep on the movie. In as much as there are actually physical effects of those explosions. So a lot of the ideas behind that started to be worked out in prep on the movie and physical effects that were going off in the movie. And the actual physical production led to a portion of the design work for the visual effects. However, all of that still continued to evolve in the post production process. So that, just as an example, is an idea that hasn't been explored in any other movies and maybe some of the technical aspects of executing that were the same as some that have been used before. But for this particular film, there was a tremendous amount of focus on how that sequence, from a visual effects standpoint and even from an editing standpoint, is art directed.</p> <p>Matt Feury<br /> How about sonically? Because, if you think about the Star Wars world, it's the sounds more than anything; the lightsabers, the blasters, the sound of an X wing and a Tie Fighter, that are so well established. But I noticed in watching the Crait battle, there's almost a new set of sounds that were really more organic, the sort of the thudding of the guns, they sounded more like organic guns and things like that. When you're cutting, do you just go back to Ben Burtt's original sound effects library because you can and you start incorporating that where and when you please?</p> <p>Bob Ducsay<br /> Well, I mean, it's a whole slew of things to be precise, because just anecdotally, the first week we were in and we started cutting the movie, my assistant does a lot of the sound effects tracking for me, and, I'd walk in in the morning and I would hear sounds that I'd heard my entire life and I wanted to know why somebody was putting Star Wars sounds in our movie. And so these are such iconic important sounds that a lot of things, some of them even go back to the original Ben Burtt designs. But then there are other things you know, we had an incredible sound team up at Skywalker. They invented many, many things that hadn't been used and some things were modified from some of the original Ben Burtt sounds. And it's interesting that you pointed out the the sort of thumping of the impacts hitting the ground because I love that sound effect. And it's something that we worked really very hard on. And what that is, is that we never really got what we wanted. And then during the dub, one of the sound effects editors who's sitting there while we're mixing the movie, tried some drum hits. And that's actually what those things are. So they're the furthest thing from explosions, but they have the right sort of emotional sense that you want from it. And this is something that we're always striving for while we're cutting the movie, both with the cutting of the movie, the telling of the story, the sound effects, the visual effects; you're always trying to evoke a strong emotion from the audience and, in that particular case, something quite unusual was used.</p> <p>Matt Feury<br /> You mentioned Snoke and we actually do have a scene from the lightsaber battle in the scene with Snoke and Rey and Kylo. Let's talk a little bit about that scene and the challenges you faced working on that particular scene.</p> <p>Bob Ducsay<br /> Well, I just I really love this scene, because, you know, the the heart of the movie to me is the "Luke, Rey Kylo" triangle, and the Rey/Kylo part of it really takes some twists and turns in this moment in this section of the film. And one of the things that was difficult about doing this movie is that we never got to screen the film for an audience, because you just don't do it because there's too many things that can't get out there. We cut the movie on the Walt Disney lot in Burbank and they built a small theater for us that seated 14 people. So the most, the biggest number of people that ever saw the movie was 14. So you don't really get the kind of reaction, you have to really kind of hope that it's working. And we had great confidence, for us, that this was awesome. And it was gonna work. But we never had any type of verification from an audience until the premiere, which happened just a few weeks before the movie was released. And for the first time, we showed the movie in front of 2500 people and the audience went nuts for the sequence and all those things that you're excited about. People were really reacting to the way that we had hoped. But you on films of this size, that isn't normally the case. You normally get to take them out and show them to somebody to understand things that the audience doesn't get or things that don't work. So that was a particular challenge and many of the things in the movie, but in this scene in particular,was something that we had really hoped would work, and thankfully it did. But I think one of the most interesting things about the sequence is, from an editorial standpoint, is that you're working with a motion capture character. And in this particular case, Andy Serkis played this character and gave a tremendous performance of which in the sequence nearly all of what you see is Andy's performance. There's a shot where Snoke looks down at the lightsaber and he looks over to Rey and Kylo. That's a keyframe shot because we didn't have that specific shot in the movie, or in the in the mocap when the movie was photographed. But besides that, most of it's, you know, nearly all Andy stuff. But the difficulty is that because you can take things from different takes, and you can, even within a shot within a close up, you can be switching takes, it adds a tremendous amount of overhead for the editor, because there are so many options as to what you can do. And I think that that's a particular complexity here. And another thing about motion capture is because ultimately, I mean, nearly all those shots are completely digital shots, including the background, what you see in the original photography, the camera doesn't have to be there. So now you could start talking about, "Well, I want the camera to do this. and I wanted to come around there". So, the director in conjunction with me, we're figuring those things out. So it adds an extra layer of complexity when things are not really there that are ultimately there in the final movie.</p> <p>Matt Feury<br /> To call this a big movie is the understatement of the year. But what kind of pressure does that put on you as an editor, in terms of time and in terms of expectations? Did you approach it the same way you'd approach a film like Looper or a film like The Mummy?</p> <p>Bob Ducsay<br /> Well, I think the main thing that you have to do, no matter what the film is, you have to try to do the best that you can to tell a great story and to do everything that you can to make the characters work absolutely the best they possibly can and to be true to themselves. So in that way, this movie is like every other film, because those are your goals and those have to be your goals no matter the budget, no matter what the resources. In this particular film, I would say the biggest pressure was simply the expectations of the film. Because people were very excited about the film, as they are on all Star Wars films, and you don't want to screw it up. So that's something that you think about every day, and all the people in my cutting room and the director and the producer, everyone loves Star Wars so much that we felt a particular responsibility to do our very best and to make [a great film]. So I would say that's the biggest pressure because you talk about schedule and all that, I mean, we had a tremendously long schedule on the film, I was on the film 19 months, and we finished three months before the movie came out. So it's at the long end of things and that's extremely helpful and also it's a little bit like driving a Maserati with a lot of gas. Because we could do so many things with it. And we had the resources to accomplish those things. So if you have an idea that might be complicated or might require some shooting, and everyone thinks it's a good idea, you have the ability to do that. Whereas in a movie like Looper, for example, we had the photography and we did everything that we could with the film, and it turned out great, of course, and some might say that having less resources may be helpful sometimes, and I would agree with that. But you didn't have the opportunity if you had a great idea that would require shooting something that you could do. And with these sorts of films, you have that ability and I think, you know, as an editor, it's liberating creatively to be able to have those resources.</p> <p>Unknown Speaker<br /> The notion of a trilogy in Star Wars is nothing new. We've gone through two of them already. In each case with George Lucas at the helm. Here again, we have a trilogy and there's a handoff between stories, but there are different production teams doing them. Literally, in the case of Last Jedi, you pick up right where Force Awakens leaves off. What sort of handoff from production teams ,what sort of conversations took place to get from A to B, so to speak?</p> <p>Bob Ducsay<br /> Well, there was a very loose, I mean, Ryan has talked about this a lot. There's a very loose connection between each of the films. There is one that exists, of course, because Ryan based his script on the episode seven script and JJ Abrams, who's making the the next film and who made the first in this trilogy, had this movie in existence as he wrote the next movie, and there are some very broad connections or things that are figured out in advance, but the majority of it is exactly as you as you mentioned, it is a baton handoff between between the movies. But if you think about it, some of that's not completely different than the first trilogy because there are certainly many things in Empire that happened that weren't necessarily completely thought out in Episode Four. So I don't think it's completely different than that.</p> <p>Matt Feury<br /> In terms of the post production setup, you know, you have your Avid system, but how many others are "cooking"? How many assistants do you have working? And do you tie in visual effects directly and sound directly? Or is it just, you deliver a package to them,</p> <p>Bob Ducsay<br /> There were a total of 10 systems on an ISIS, plus two more software-only systems that we're done for doing turnovers and generating QuickTimes. So that's a dozen systems. One of them was in our theater, because everything that we made it was, you know, you could run DCP's in there, but really what we ran in there all the time was directly out of an Avid that was in the theater. And, you know, the project, of course, is shared among everyone on the team, and then as far as the visual effects are concerned, ILM, who was the vendor on the movie and did nearly all the visual effects in the film, they essentially had the same movie. So the way that we worked with them was we just sent bins back and forth, because they had all the media for the film so, it wored really well. I mean, essentially, you're just sending these small files back and forth from the bins to collaborate.</p> <p>Matt Feury<br /> So you're on location at Pinewood. Most of the editorial I'm assuming down there is about dailies and putting together basic scene structure, and then you bring it back to LA to do the finished editing or is the whole thing done up...</p> <p>Bob Ducsay<br /> So the shooting schedule is long on the movie. It was like 120 days, and that's a little bit over six months of shooting. And then I got back to LA and Ryan came in two weeks after we got back to LA and we started to watch the movie. Now, the way that he and I work is the movie was on nine reels. It was a long movie, and he came in day one, and we went through reel one and we did a pass through a reel one. And we worked our way through the whole movie. And once we made it to the end of the film, we put the whole film, well the film was together of course, but we went and ran it in the theater for the first time. And so that was, that was pretty much the procedure for us. That isn't necessarily the case on every feature film because usually what happens is, you know, roughly two weeks after you're done shooting, everybody comes down, the director comes in, the producer comes in, maybe the producer comes in and we all sit down and we watch the film, but in this case Ryan wanted to take a reel by reel pass which he and I did on Looper and I think that works really well.</p> <p>Matt Feury<br /> So there are multiple storylines always going on in this film. You know, one of the things you did, you sort of broke away from the A" story and you have the casino planet stuff. Are you bouncing back and forth between things or do you literally just do a hard wall like, "Okay, now we're going to work for the next so many weeks and months on this storyline".</p> <p>Bob Ducsay<br /> Well, look, I mean, it's a little bit of both because what happens is you screen the movie, and every time you screen the movie you go, "Oh, jeez, that doesn't work. It worked before but it doesn't work now. What happened"? So you'll go and you'll concentrate on things that are problematic. But generally speaking, the way that we work and the way I personally prefer to work, and this is how Ryan works, is we screened the movie, and then we go back to reel one, and we work our way through the movie. And we did this process, I would say, it would take us about two weeks to turn the movie around. So every two weeks we would sit down and we'd watch the movie. And you know, we did our best within our small group to try to keep people fresh, because we really couldn't show the movie to anybody except our group. And occasionally, you know, there were a lot of filmmakers who came in to see the film as we're working but that was basically the process, and every two weeks we go watch the movie again.</p> <p>Matt Feury<br /> The original editor's cut...how long was that first cut that you did?</p> <p>Bob Ducsay<br /> The very first cut of the movie was three hours and ten minutes. And the finished film, the actual run of the film without credits is I think two hours and twenty-one minutes. So what is that? That's fifty minutes of material. I mean, a certain amount of that is fat. I mean, I try to get to where we want to go immediately. So a little bit of it is just, "well, you really don't need that", but a lot of it's actual sequences and scenes and the blu-ray's got a lot of deleted material. It's over thirty minutes worth of material. And of course, there's other stuff that we didn't include on that. So, you know, it's a good amount of material that's cut out of the film.</p> <p>Matt Feury<br /> Yeah, I think one of the things that, when the blu-ray first came out, there was a lot of talk about the, you know, Finn vs. Captain Phasma scene. How different that was {from the theatrical cut]. What was the decision, and you probably have to set it up for everybody, the difference between what was in the movie and what was cut out, what was your decision making process in terms of like, "No, we don't need to see her, you know, the stormtroopers around realize that she was a traitor" and all that?</p> <p>Bob Ducsay<br /> Well, if you're familiar with the film, what we're talking about is, there was a there was an encounter between Finn and Phasma on the top of an elevator, he basically calls her out to what she did in Episode Seven, basically kind of being weak. And she kills a couple of stormtroopers. And the he kills her in a different way. And it was pretty good, actually. But the thing is, when you got to this sequence, you felt that it was way too long, like, way too long. And so that was the biggest cut we made in the scene, although we did a lot of other compression in it, to try to get the time down. And in fact, we actually considered cutting the whole sequence. You know, literally not having any of that in the film. And ultimately, everybody that we were showing the movie to including the studio really liked the sequence. And we didn't think it was enough of a problem to take the scene out. But that is an interesting area, and that has specifically to do with pace. Many, many things that came out of the movie came out because of pace.</p> <p>Matt Feury<br /> So you went right from Last Jedi into Rampage. How much of a break did you have between the two because it seems like after a campaign like this, whether it was an easy cut, or it was a challenging film, you'd want a little bit of a break and some down time.</p> <p>Bob Ducsay<br /> Well, I knew the director on Rampage and I knew the picture editor that started it because I didn't actually start the film. I came on right after they finished the director's cut. And, so I came on to help, which they absolutely needed help because their schedule...we just got done talking about nineteen months to make this unbelievably complicated movie here...on that movie (Rampage), they were, from the time they started photography to the time that it's in the theaters is less than a year and it has an enormous amount of creature effects in it which are extremely complicated and time consuming, etc. So that film had a very, very compressed schedule and Jim May who was the principal editor on the movie, he'd done an incredible job getting the movie in the shape that it was in, but there was just too much work to do for one person.</p> <p>Matt Feury<br /> You know, from a career standpoint as an editor, looking at your body of work...heavy in science fiction. From The Mummy, The Mummy Returns and Looper and Jedi and Rampage. Do you feel like that's the lane you want to stay in and continue building in that genre? Or do you get to this point and go, "You know what, I'd like to do a romantic comedy or some sort of smaller indie drama"?</p> <p>Bob Ducsay<br /> It's a complicated question, because the thing is, the kind of movies I got to do are the kind of movies that I loved growing up. And I can't believe that I got to do this. And, you know, this movie in particular, I was a huge Star Wars fan. And to be able to live this dream was, I mean, I honestly, I still can't believe I got to do this film. So I love these sorts of films. But I find that I go to a lot of movies that are not these sorts of films. And so my interests are extremely wide. And I mean, to me, the most important thing is, is it a good story with good characters, and those are the things that interest me the most, but you know, I feel a little bit like Michael in The Godfather Three, every time I think I'm out, they pulled me back in. And so because I do these sorts of films, people want you to do these sorts of films and so it becomes a little bit of a, you know, a self fulfilling prophecy. But that's okay though. I'm not complaining. I love it.</p> <p>Matt Feury<br /> Well, I'm glad you got to live that dream. I'm glad you got to do that film that you always wanted to do, being a Star Wars fan, and I'm thrilled that you we're able to be here with us today. And I'd like everybody to help me in thanking Mr. Ducsay for being here today.</p>]]></description>

Nice to be here with you.</p> <p>Matt Feury Okay, so that was a little intense. Reflections? Thoughts? What do you remember most about cutting that sequence there?</p> <p>Bob Ducsay It looks exhausting to do.</p> <p>Matt Feury It felt exhausting.</p> <p>Bob Ducsay I know. But interestingly enough, this particular sequence had challenges that you wouldn't necessarily guess because a lot of the great complexities of the sequence were worked out in prep and in early post production. In this particular case, in early post production. This sequence was pre-visualized, which is sort of a low resolution cartoon that's made of the sequence. But what happens in a sequence like that is you have this template that you start with, but then you start to make all of the changes in the sequence as the photography comes in, and this sequence was no different in that way. And one of the big challenges of a sequence like this is because it's so visual effects intensive. In my editorial job, I'm heavily involved with the visual effects, and mapping all that out, and how all of those things interact, and all of the timings, even though some of those things will have been worked out, you know, as a template and a starting point in the pre-vis, there's an enormous amount more work that has to happen. So this sequence is really a lot about the complexity of the visual effects. But you get all of these extra things when you're shooting. And so the sequence changes and evolves over time. And another thing about the sequence is, this isn't the whole Battle of Crait. This isn't just a clip from it. But even what's in the final movie was considerably shorter than what was originally envisioned and photograph but, you know, in the total run of the movie, we found that it was a little bit long, so we compressed it. So those are the sort of challenges that a sequence like this has.</p> <p>Matt Feury You mentioned the animatic part of it. I found that really interesting, the pre-prep, because I remember a lot of the talk about the original Star Wars back in 1977, George Lucas would cut together shots of aerial dogfights from old World War Two movies, as a point of reference, and this is very similar to that, where you're literally putting together a sequence that represents what you're finally going to do, and then laying over the new shots on top of that.</p> <p>Bob Ducsay Well, to some degree, yes. And I mean, that's amazing what they did back in, you know, 1976, when they were making the movie. Because they didn't have the ability, they didn't have these tools that we have now. So, it's a fantastic way of envisioning and it's something that we kind of refer to as rip-o-matics. And we still do those sort of things because even in this film, there are times when you want something that just represents something that you think you need, and if we can go to another movie that we know has something like that, it could be another Star Wars movie, but it could be something completely different depending on the idea. And we'll source that and put it that in as a temporary thing that might only represent what the camera is supposed to do. It might represent the rough length of the thing. But it's something to allow us to envision what we're looking for and what we need from the visual effects guys, and then ultimately what happens in post production on these movies is that you have a post-viz department. And what that is, is there's a series of animators that are around that you can literally walk down the hall and you could say, I need a shot where the Falcon dodges this TIE Fighter moving left to right, and does this sort of thing. And they will build that shot. And then that shot becomes a template for for ILM to do the visual effect. So it's a very iterative process, but it's an unbelievable tool that allows us to represent things that don't exist.</p> <p>Matt Feury So I find that, as I do these interviews, I forget until the very end to ask about the overall process and people go, "Why didn't you ask them what they shot and what the editing room setup was like"? So, could you just walk us through a brief synopsis of the editorial process from the handoff from production into post and over to the other viz and sound departments?</p> <p>Bob Ducsay Sure. Well, the the movie was photographed principally in the United Kingdom, outside of London, at Pinewood Studios. And at Pinewood, FotoKem, which was one of our vendors, the lab vendor, they built a digital lab there, including scanning. So all the scanning was in house and just for our operation. The movie was photographed I'd say somewhere around 70%, maybe 75% on 35 millimeter scope film. And then the rest of it was a combination of Alexa digital Alexa 65 digital and some small amount of IMAX. So the film would come in, they'd scan everything at 4K, they would build DNX 115 files for us to use in editorial but then they would generate all the other various needs for people, including pulling material for ILM, because we're turning visual effects over while we're shooting. And so there was a whole infrastructure put together for this particular film that was specific to this film.</p> <p>Matt Feury Early on in your career you did films like The Mummy, The Mummy Returns. And those were groundbreaking in terms of the visual effects stuff done there. There were treatments that you used in those films that became points of reference for years after that, with the particle effects that you did. Here in Star Wars, you already have this sort of, it feels like a template about the visual world there. Did you find that constraining that you had to sort of conform to this way of doing things, or did you take the existing elements and tweak them and take them in different directions?</p> <p>Bob Ducsay Well, when you talk about some things in the movie,. I mean, it is true, you know, a Tie Fighter looks like a Tie Fighter, an X wing looks like an X wing. And so there are some things that a really strong template exists for, but then there's many, many things that are specific to this film that are designed from the ground up. I mean, if you think of the sequence with Snoke, who Andy Serkis plays in motion capture, and he's a digital character. So that's all very, very specific to this film, and there's there's a lot of things that are like that. And then even in like this sequence, you know, the the skim speeders, which are the vehicles that you saw in this clip, one of the things that Ryan Johnson the director wanted was he had a very, very specific, I'm going to call it "art direction" notion of what that material should look like, and what the colors should be. And this went into prep on the movie. In as much as there are actually physical effects of those explosions. So a lot of the ideas behind that started to be worked out in prep on the movie and physical effects that were going off in the movie. And the actual physical production led to a portion of the design work for the visual effects. However, all of that still continued to evolve in the post production process. So that, just as an example, is an idea that hasn't been explored in any other movies and maybe some of the technical aspects of executing that were the same as some that have been used before. But for this particular film, there was a tremendous amount of focus on how that sequence, from a visual effects standpoint and even from an editing standpoint, is art directed.</p> <p>Matt Feury How about sonically? Because, if you think about the Star Wars world, it's the sounds more than anything; the lightsabers, the blasters, the sound of an X wing and a Tie Fighter, that are so well established. But I noticed in watching the Crait battle, there's almost a new set of sounds that were really more organic, the sort of the thudding of the guns, they sounded more like organic guns and things like that. When you're cutting, do you just go back to Ben Burtt's original sound effects library because you can and you start incorporating that where and when you please?</p> <p>Bob Ducsay Well, I mean, it's a whole slew of things to be precise, because just anecdotally, the first week we were in and we started cutting the movie, my assistant does a lot of the sound effects tracking for me, and, I'd walk in in the morning and I would hear sounds that I'd heard my entire life and I wanted to know why somebody was putting Star Wars sounds in our movie. And so these are such iconic important sounds that a lot of things, some of them even go back to the original Ben Burtt designs. But then there are other things you know, we had an incredible sound team up at Skywalker. They invented many, many things that hadn't been used and some things were modified from some of the original Ben Burtt sounds. And it's interesting that you pointed out the the sort of thumping of the impacts hitting the ground because I love that sound effect. And it's something that we worked really very hard on. And what that is, is that we never really got what we wanted. And then during the dub, one of the sound effects editors who's sitting there while we're mixing the movie, tried some drum hits. And that's actually what those things are. So they're the furthest thing from explosions, but they have the right sort of emotional sense that you want from it. And this is something that we're always striving for while we're cutting the movie, both with the cutting of the movie, the telling of the story, the sound effects, the visual effects; you're always trying to evoke a strong emotion from the audience and, in that particular case, something quite unusual was used.</p> <p>Matt Feury You mentioned Snoke and we actually do have a scene from the lightsaber battle in the scene with Snoke and Rey and Kylo. Let's talk a little bit about that scene and the challenges you faced working on that particular scene.</p> <p>Bob Ducsay Well, I just I really love this scene, because, you know, the the heart of the movie to me is the "Luke, Rey Kylo" triangle, and the Rey/Kylo part of it really takes some twists and turns in this moment in this section of the film. And one of the things that was difficult about doing this movie is that we never got to screen the film for an audience, because you just don't do it because there's too many things that can't get out there. We cut the movie on the Walt Disney lot in Burbank and they built a small theater for us that seated 14 people. So the most, the biggest number of people that ever saw the movie was 14. So you don't really get the kind of reaction, you have to really kind of hope that it's working. And we had great confidence, for us, that this was awesome. And it was gonna work. But we never had any type of verification from an audience until the premiere, which happened just a few weeks before the movie was released. And for the first time, we showed the movie in front of 2500 people and the audience went nuts for the sequence and all those things that you're excited about. People were really reacting to the way that we had hoped. But you on films of this size, that isn't normally the case. You normally get to take them out and show them to somebody to understand things that the audience doesn't get or things that don't work. So that was a particular challenge and many of the things in the movie, but in this scene in particular,was something that we had really hoped would work, and thankfully it did. But I think one of the most interesting things about the sequence is, from an editorial standpoint, is that you're working with a motion capture character. And in this particular case, Andy Serkis played this character and gave a tremendous performance of which in the sequence nearly all of what you see is Andy's performance. There's a shot where Snoke looks down at the lightsaber and he looks over to Rey and Kylo. That's a keyframe shot because we didn't have that specific shot in the movie, or in the in the mocap when the movie was photographed. But besides that, most of it's, you know, nearly all Andy stuff. But the difficulty is that because you can take things from different takes, and you can, even within a shot within a close up, you can be switching takes, it adds a tremendous amount of overhead for the editor, because there are so many options as to what you can do. And I think that that's a particular complexity here. And another thing about motion capture is because ultimately, I mean, nearly all those shots are completely digital shots, including the background, what you see in the original photography, the camera doesn't have to be there. So now you could start talking about, "Well, I want the camera to do this. and I wanted to come around there". So, the director in conjunction with me, we're figuring those things out. So it adds an extra layer of complexity when things are not really there that are ultimately there in the final movie.</p> <p>Matt Feury To call this a big movie is the understatement of the year. But what kind of pressure does that put on you as an editor, in terms of time and in terms of expectations? Did you approach it the same way you'd approach a film like Looper or a film like The Mummy?</p> <p>Bob Ducsay Well, I think the main thing that you have to do, no matter what the film is, you have to try to do the best that you can to tell a great story and to do everything that you can to make the characters work absolutely the best they possibly can and to be true to themselves. So in that way, this movie is like every other film, because those are your goals and those have to be your goals no matter the budget, no matter what the resources. In this particular film, I would say the biggest pressure was simply the expectations of the film. Because people were very excited about the film, as they are on all Star Wars films, and you don't want to screw it up. So that's something that you think about every day, and all the people in my cutting room and the director and the producer, everyone loves Star Wars so much that we felt a particular responsibility to do our very best and to make [a great film]. So I would say that's the biggest pressure because you talk about schedule and all that, I mean, we had a tremendously long schedule on the film, I was on the film 19 months, and we finished three months before the movie came out. So it's at the long end of things and that's extremely helpful and also it's a little bit like driving a Maserati with a lot of gas. Because we could do so many things with it. And we had the resources to accomplish those things. So if you have an idea that might be complicated or might require some shooting, and everyone thinks it's a good idea, you have the ability to do that. Whereas in a movie like Looper, for example, we had the photography and we did everything that we could with the film, and it turned out great, of course, and some might say that having less resources may be helpful sometimes, and I would agree with that. But you didn't have the opportunity if you had a great idea that would require shooting something that you could do. And with these sorts of films, you have that ability and I think, you know, as an editor, it's liberating creatively to be able to have those resources.</p> <p>Unknown Speaker The notion of a trilogy in Star Wars is nothing new. We've gone through two of them already. In each case with George Lucas at the helm. Here again, we have a trilogy and there's a handoff between stories, but there are different production teams doing them. Literally, in the case of Last Jedi, you pick up right where Force Awakens leaves off. What sort of handoff from production teams ,what sort of conversations took place to get from A to B, so to speak?</p> <p>Bob Ducsay Well, there was a very loose, I mean, Ryan has talked about this a lot. There's a very loose connection between each of the films. There is one that exists, of course, because Ryan based his script on the episode seven script and JJ Abrams, who's making the the next film and who made the first in this trilogy, had this movie in existence as he wrote the next movie, and there are some very broad connections or things that are figured out in advance, but the majority of it is exactly as you as you mentioned, it is a baton handoff between between the movies. But if you think about it, some of that's not completely different than the first trilogy because there are certainly many things in Empire that happened that weren't necessarily completely thought out in Episode Four. So I don't think it's completely different than that.</p> <p>Matt Feury In terms of the post production setup, you know, you have your Avid system, but how many others are "cooking"? How many assistants do you have working? And do you tie in visual effects directly and sound directly? Or is it just, you deliver a package to them,</p> <p>Bob Ducsay There were a total of 10 systems on an ISIS, plus two more software-only systems that we're done for doing turnovers and generating QuickTimes. So that's a dozen systems. One of them was in our theater, because everything that we made it was, you know, you could run DCP's in there, but really what we ran in there all the time was directly out of an Avid that was in the theater. And, you know, the project, of course, is shared among everyone on the team, and then as far as the visual effects are concerned, ILM, who was the vendor on the movie and did nearly all the visual effects in the film, they essentially had the same movie. So the way that we worked with them was we just sent bins back and forth, because they had all the media for the film so, it wored really well. I mean, essentially, you're just sending these small files back and forth from the bins to collaborate.</p> <p>Matt Feury So you're on location at Pinewood. Most of the editorial I'm assuming down there is about dailies and putting together basic scene structure, and then you bring it back to LA to do the finished editing or is the whole thing done up...</p> <p>Bob Ducsay So the shooting schedule is long on the movie. It was like 120 days, and that's a little bit over six months of shooting. And then I got back to LA and Ryan came in two weeks after we got back to LA and we started to watch the movie. Now, the way that he and I work is the movie was on nine reels. It was a long movie, and he came in day one, and we went through reel one and we did a pass through a reel one. And we worked our way through the whole movie. And once we made it to the end of the film, we put the whole film, well the film was together of course, but we went and ran it in the theater for the first time. And so that was, that was pretty much the procedure for us. That isn't necessarily the case on every feature film because usually what happens is, you know, roughly two weeks after you're done shooting, everybody comes down, the director comes in, the producer comes in, maybe the producer comes in and we all sit down and we watch the film, but in this case Ryan wanted to take a reel by reel pass which he and I did on Looper and I think that works really well.</p> <p>Matt Feury So there are multiple storylines always going on in this film. You know, one of the things you did, you sort of broke away from the A" story and you have the casino planet stuff. Are you bouncing back and forth between things or do you literally just do a hard wall like, "Okay, now we're going to work for the next so many weeks and months on this storyline".</p> <p>Bob Ducsay Well, look, I mean, it's a little bit of both because what happens is you screen the movie, and every time you screen the movie you go, "Oh, jeez, that doesn't work. It worked before but it doesn't work now. What happened"? So you'll go and you'll concentrate on things that are problematic. But generally speaking, the way that we work and the way I personally prefer to work, and this is how Ryan works, is we screened the movie, and then we go back to reel one, and we work our way through the movie. And we did this process, I would say, it would take us about two weeks to turn the movie around. So every two weeks we would sit down and we'd watch the movie. And you know, we did our best within our small group to try to keep people fresh, because we really couldn't show the movie to anybody except our group. And occasionally, you know, there were a lot of filmmakers who came in to see the film as we're working but that was basically the process, and every two weeks we go watch the movie again.</p> <p>Matt Feury The original editor's cut...how long was that first cut that you did?</p> <p>Bob Ducsay The very first cut of the movie was three hours and ten minutes. And the finished film, the actual run of the film without credits is I think two hours and twenty-one minutes. So what is that? That's fifty minutes of material. I mean, a certain amount of that is fat. I mean, I try to get to where we want to go immediately. So a little bit of it is just, "well, you really don't need that", but a lot of it's actual sequences and scenes and the blu-ray's got a lot of deleted material. It's over thirty minutes worth of material. And of course, there's other stuff that we didn't include on that. So, you know, it's a good amount of material that's cut out of the film.</p> <p>Matt Feury Yeah, I think one of the things that, when the blu-ray first came out, there was a lot of talk about the, you know, Finn vs. Captain Phasma scene. How different that was {from the theatrical cut]. What was the decision, and you probably have to set it up for everybody, the difference between what was in the movie and what was cut out, what was your decision making process in terms of like, "No, we don't need to see her, you know, the stormtroopers around realize that she was a traitor" and all that?</p> <p>Bob Ducsay Well, if you're familiar with the film, what we're talking about is, there was a there was an encounter between Finn and Phasma on the top of an elevator, he basically calls her out to what she did in Episode Seven, basically kind of being weak. And she kills a couple of stormtroopers. And the he kills her in a different way. And it was pretty good, actually. But the thing is, when you got to this sequence, you felt that it was way too long, like, way too long. And so that was the biggest cut we made in the scene, although we did a lot of other compression in it, to try to get the time down. And in fact, we actually considered cutting the whole sequence. You know, literally not having any of that in the film. And ultimately, everybody that we were showing the movie to including the studio really liked the sequence. And we didn't think it was enough of a problem to take the scene out. But that is an interesting area, and that has specifically to do with pace. Many, many things that came out of the movie came out because of pace.</p> <p>Matt Feury So you went right from Last Jedi into Rampage. How much of a break did you have between the two because it seems like after a campaign like this, whether it was an easy cut, or it was a challenging film, you'd want a little bit of a break and some down time.</p> <p>Bob Ducsay Well, I knew the director on Rampage and I knew the picture editor that started it because I didn't actually start the film. I came on right after they finished the director's cut. And, so I came on to help, which they absolutely needed help because their schedule...we just got done talking about nineteen months to make this unbelievably complicated movie here...on that movie (Rampage), they were, from the time they started photography to the time that it's in the theaters is less than a year and it has an enormous amount of creature effects in it which are extremely complicated and time consuming, etc. So that film had a very, very compressed schedule and Jim May who was the principal editor on the movie, he'd done an incredible job getting the movie in the shape that it was in, but there was just too much work to do for one person.</p> <p>Matt Feury You know, from a career standpoint as an editor, looking at your body of work...heavy in science fiction. From The Mummy, The Mummy Returns and Looper and Jedi and Rampage. Do you feel like that's the lane you want to stay in and continue building in that genre? Or do you get to this point and go, "You know what, I'd like to do a romantic comedy or some sort of smaller indie drama"?</p> <p>Bob Ducsay It's a complicated question, because the thing is, the kind of movies I got to do are the kind of movies that I loved growing up. And I can't believe that I got to do this. And, you know, this movie in particular, I was a huge Star Wars fan. And to be able to live this dream was, I mean, I honestly, I still can't believe I got to do this film. So I love these sorts of films. But I find that I go to a lot of movies that are not these sorts of films. And so my interests are extremely wide. And I mean, to me, the most important thing is, is it a good story with good characters, and those are the things that interest me the most, but you know, I feel a little bit like Michael in The Godfather Three, every time I think I'm out, they pulled me back in. And so because I do these sorts of films, people want you to do these sorts of films and so it becomes a little bit of a, you know, a self fulfilling prophecy. But that's okay though. I'm not complaining. I love it.</p> <p>Matt Feury Well, I'm glad you got to live that dream. I'm glad you got to do that film that you always wanted to do, being a Star Wars fan, and I'm thrilled that you we're able to be here with us today. And I'd like everybody to help me in thanking Mr. Ducsay for being here today.</p>]]></content:encoded>
